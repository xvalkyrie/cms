Description
===

An open source project. A CMS without a name (yet), with the intent to transform into a social CMS.

Goals
===

The goal of this project is to make a simple open source CMS that can be expanded into a fully featured open source Social CMS. This project will either be expanded into a Social CMS over time or forked into a separate project and the original CMS left intact.

Development Focus

In no order...

1. themable
2. pluggable
3. hookable
3. easily modified through a single file (think functions.php)
4. widget areas
4. readable code
5. SEO friendly
6. fast page load times
7. one click installs/updates
8. DRY
